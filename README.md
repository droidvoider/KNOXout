# KNOXout
A PoC of Galaxy S6 rooting based on the [CVE-2016-6584 vulnerability](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6584)

It uses [iovyroot](https://github.com/dosomder/iovyroot) by dosomder/idler1984 for initial kernel write-what-where vulnerability.

Edited: getroot.h so that it will compile for arm64-v8a.
Note 5 Sept Security Patch
knoxout reports 'device not supported then correctly displays the model number SM-N920A'



*** Could just need minor adjustments but I'm working on another angrle right now ***
